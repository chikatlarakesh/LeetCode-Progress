# Problem Name: Pascal's Triangle

## Problem Description:
Generate Pascal's Triangle up to `numRows` rows. Each row of Pascal's Triangle is generated by summing adjacent values from the previous row.

## Approach:
1. Initialize an empty result vector to store the rows of Pascal's Triangle.
2. Loop through each row from 0 to `numRows - 1`:
   - Create a new row vector initialized with 1s.
   - For each element in the row (except the first and last), set it to the sum of the two elements directly above it from the previous row.
   - Append the row to the result vector.
3. Return the result vector containing all rows of Pascal's Triangle.

## Time Complexity:
Time complexity is O(numRows^2), where `numRows` is the number of rows in Pascal's Triangle. Each element is calculated once, and there are a total of O(numRows^2) elements.

## Space Complexity:
Space complexity is O(numRows^2) due to the space required to store the entire triangle.
