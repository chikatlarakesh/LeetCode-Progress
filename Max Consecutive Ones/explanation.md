## Find Max Consecutive Ones

- **Problem**: Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.
- **Approach**: Loop through the array and maintain a count of consecutive 1's. Reset the count when a 0 is encountered, and keep track of the maximum count.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where `n` is the size of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as no extra space is used apart from a few variables.
