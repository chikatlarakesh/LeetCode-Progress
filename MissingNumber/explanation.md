Solved "Missing Number" on LeetCode ðŸš€

Today, I tackled the "Missing Number" problem, which required finding the missing number in an array containing n distinct numbers ranging from 0 to n.

My Approach:
I used the XOR bitwise operation to solve this problem efficiently:
XOR all numbers from 0 to n and all elements in the array.
The final XOR result gives the missing number.

Result: 
Runtime: 0 msâ€”solved efficiently for all test cases.
